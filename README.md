# CSE310
Applied Programming Class
# Overview

This project demonstrates a simple "Hello World" program using JavaScript and HTML. As a software engineer, this exercise is designed to enhance my understanding of the basics of JavaScript and its interaction with HTML. It provides a foundation for developing more complex web applications.

The software displays a "Hello World" message as a prompt in the browser when run on a local server. This program helps beginners understand how JavaScript can manipulate the browser's behavior and interact with HTML files.

# Purpose

The purpose of creating this software is to practice using JavaScript for basic functionality in a web development environment. It also provides a starting point for understanding client-side scripting and interacting with users through browser prompts.

# Development Environment

The following tools were used to develop this software:

- **Code Editor:** Visual Studio Code
- **Programming Language:** JavaScript and HTML
- **Local Server:** Live Server extension in Visual Studio Code (serving the program on `localhost:5500`)

# Useful Websites

- [MDN Web Docs - JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)

# Running the Program

To run the program:

1. Save the following code in an `index.html` file.
2. Open the file in Visual Studio Code.
3. Use the Live Server extension to serve the file on `localhost:5500`.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Hello World</title>
</head>
<body>
    <script>
        // Display a "Hello World" prompt in the browser
        prompt('Hello World');
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5500/index.html`.
5. A browser prompt will appear displaying the message "Hello World".
